Greeks, Romans, they are all human
While they lived, they columns built
Earthquake earthquake earthquake
Run apple, run orange, run banana
Diego, a coffee with saccharin
Sauce tequila heart beer very good
Let's solve this by hyperplanes
Let's go atoms, come on, let's go
Lisa, in this house we follow the laws of thermodynamics
And if he was so smart how is he dead?
