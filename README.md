Dream of a Javiti’s night

This is a videogame based on real life. Everything happened last year, when we all went to a carnival party which ended at 6 am. Everybody had to come back to their homes in order to sleep, some by car, others by train… However, Javiti returned by metro and as he had drunk too much water he fell asleep as soon as he entered in the line 10. He was so asleep that he didn’t notice when he arrived to his station so he had a deep dream…
Furthermore, this videogame tells the story of every single dream that Javiti had, while you are playing it and having careful not to die, because then you will have to restart the dream in which you have died. The videogame ends when Javiti arrive home.
